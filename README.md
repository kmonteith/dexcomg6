Hi All, 

I disabled the App Compaitability on the dexcom g6 app. To install on your device download the apk and install(Enable install from unknown devices). This should work on android phones using android 4 and up!. 

If you  have any other suggested changes you can email me at kmonteith25@gmail.com, make sure to subject it Dexcom App Update Ideas.

If you would like to donate to help support future efforts you can do so here: https://www.paypal.me/KevinMonteith .
